                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>From an early age, I have always been fascinated by
                    technology and its ability to solve real-world
                    problems. My curiosity led me to pursue a career in
                    software development, where I have honed my
                    technical skills and creativity. I specialize in web
                    development but also have a keen interest in
                    mobile app development and AI integration.
                    Over the past few years, I have worked on a variety of
                    projects ranging from simple websites to more
                    complex applications. My goal with every project is to
                    deliver clean, efficient, and scalable code,
                    while also focusing on user experience and design. I pride
                    myself on being detail-oriented and
                    maintaining a high standard of quality in everything I
                    do.</p>
